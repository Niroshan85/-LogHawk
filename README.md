## Automating LogHawk with Cron
In the cron table, you'll define when to run the LogHawk script. For example, to run the script every hour, add the following line:
Use the crontab command to open the cron table for editing.
```bash
crontab -e
```
```bash
0 * * * * /path/to/python /path/to/loghawk.py >> /path/to/loghawk.log 2>&1
```
To verify that the cron job was added successfully, you can list your cron jobs:
```bash
crontab -l
```

## Twilio SMS Alerts ‚ÄºÔ∏è
To receive real-time alerts via SMS, configure your Twilio credentials in `loghawk.py`:
```python
ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_account_sid'
AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_auth_token'
FROM_PHONE = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
TO_PHONE = 'recipient_phone_number'
```
